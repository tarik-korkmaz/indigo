## What is this?

Expensify is an expense tracking software. It is a web application I created by following [this][1] React course. Source code can be found [here][2].

---

## How it works?

A Google account is needed to use the application. After authentication, users can save their expenses which consists of a description, amount, date and an optional note. It is possible to search expenses by name and to sort them by their date or amount. It is also possible to filter them based on a date range.
