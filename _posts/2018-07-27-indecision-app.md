## What is this?

Have you ever found yourself struggling to decide what to do among few options? Indecision is exactly for those moments. It is a web application I created by following [this][1] React course. Source code can be found [here][2].

---

## How it works?

Users create a list of options to choose from. Indecision App chooses one of the options randomly.

---

## How can I try it?

You can follow [this link][3] and use Indecision to choose an option for you. 

---

## Which tools are used?

* React
* Webpack
* Babel
* Express.js (just for setting up a little development server)
* Sass
